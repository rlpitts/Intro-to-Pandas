### Welcome to an Introduction to Pandas (for Data Science)

This is the course material for my brand new Intro to Pandas course. I expect that things will change in future iterations as I get a better feel for how long each part takes, learn more about certain aspects of Pandas' HPC-related features, and as Pandas itself continues to develop its relatively recent functionality for HPC systems and data sets larger than available memory.

If you only plan to watch the lectures, you don't technically have to download anything, but all the materials are here in case you feel like you missed anything during the presentation. If you plan to participate in the exercises or run the demos, you will need access to a Python distibution of version 3.8 or later.

To follow along or tinker with the **demos** during the presentation, you will need to download `PandasIntro.ipynb` and the exoplanets CSV file.

To do the **exercises**, you will need to download `PandasExercises.ipynb`, `covid19_italy_region.csv`, and `ita_pop_by_reg,txt`. The solutions are also provided, but you are encouraged to try the exercises without them first.

The PDF is a copy of the lecture slides.
