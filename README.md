### Welcome to an Introduction to Pandas (for Data Science)

This is the course material for Intro to Pandas for Data Science. This is a dynamic repository, as both lesson plans and Pandas itself evolve.

If you only plan to watch the lectures, you don't technically have to download anything, but all the materials are here in case you feel like you missed anything during the presentation. If you plan to participate in the exercises or run the demos, you will need access to a Python distibution of version 3.8 or later, and Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook. To follow-along with the last demo embedded in the lectures, you should also make sure you have Numba installed or loaded.

At most HPC centers, if you are not using Anaconda3, Pandas will be hidden in the Scipy-bundle module along with Numpy. Jupyter, Matplotlib, and Numba are generally separate, but facilities vary as far as which modules are available where. I won't have time to cover all possiblities, so please make sure you can find or install what you need before the class starts if you plan to do the exercises.

To follow along or tinker with the **demos** during the presentation, you will need to download `PandasIntro.ipynb`, the exoplanets CSV file, and `numba_demo.py`, as well as `numba_demo.sh` if you are on a cluster.

To do the **exercises**, you will need to download `PandasExercises-empty.ipynb`, `covid19_italy_region.csv`, and `ita_pop_by_reg.txt`. The solutions are also provided, but you are encouraged to try the exercises without them first.

The PDF is a copy of the lecture slides.
